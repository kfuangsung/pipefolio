.. py:class:: AdaptorPipeMixin

   AdaptorPipeMixin class that provides a reverse pipe operator for optimization objects.

   This mixin enables the use of the reverse pipe operator (`|`) with optimization
   results, allowing for seamless integration with adaptor classes that transform
   optimization results.

   .. method:: __ror__(self, other

      BaseOptimization):
      Applies the fit_transform method if the other object is an instance of BaseOptimization.
      Raises a TypeError if the operation is not supported for the given types.
      


   .. py:method:: __ror__(other)

      Reverse pipe operator for BaseOptimization.

      :param other: The optimization result to be transformed.
      :type other: BaseOptimization

      :returns: The result of applying the fit_transform method on the optimization result.

      :raises TypeError: If the operand types are not supported for this operation.



.. py:class:: TransformerPipeMixin

   TransformerPipeMixin class that provides pipe operators for transformer classes.

   This mixin enables the use of the pipe operator (`|`) and the reverse pipe operator
   (`|`) with transformer classes, allowing for seamless integration with other
   classes that take a DataPlaceHolder as input.

   Attributes:

   .. method:: __or__(self, other

      BaseOptimization):
      Applies the fit_transform method if the other object is an instance of BaseOptimization.
      Raises a TypeError if the operation is not supported for the given types.

   .. method:: __ror__(self, other

      DataPlaceHolder):
      Applies the fit_transform method if the other object is an instance of DataPlaceHolder.
      Raises a TypeError if the operation is not supported for the given types.
      


   .. py:method:: __or__(other)

      Pipe operator for BaseOptimization.

      :param other: The optimization result to be transformed.
      :type other: BaseOptimization

      :returns: The result of applying the fit_transform method on the optimization result.

      :raises TypeError: If the operand types are not supported for this operation.



   .. py:method:: __ror__(other)

      Reverse pipe operator for DataPlaceHolder.

      :param other: The input data to be transformed.
      :type other: DataPlaceHolder

      :returns: The result of applying the fit_transform method on the input data.

      :raises TypeError: If the operand types are not supported for this operation.



.. py:class:: OptimizerPipeMixin

   OptimizerPipeMixin class that provides a reverse pipe operator for optimization classes.

   This mixin enables the use of the reverse pipe operator (`|`) with optimization
   classes, allowing for seamless integration with other classes that take a
   DataPlaceHolder as input.

   Attributes:

   .. method:: __ror__(self, other

      DataPlaceHolder):
      Applies the fit method if the other object is an instance of DataPlaceHolder.
      Raises a TypeError if the operation is not supported for the given types.
      


   .. py:method:: __ror__(other)

      Reverse pipe operator for DataPlaceHolder.

      :param other: The input data to be optimized.
      :type other: DataPlaceHolder

      :returns: The result of applying the fit method on the input data.

      :raises TypeError: If the operand types are not supported for this operation.



.. py:class:: SelectorPipeMixin

   SelectorPipeMixin class that provides a reverse pipe operator for selector classes.

   This mixin enables the use of the reverse pipe operator (`|`) with selector
   classes, allowing for seamless integration with other classes that take a
   DataPlaceHolder as input.

   Attributes:

   .. method:: __ror__(self, other

      DataPlaceHolder):
      Applies the fit_transform method if the other object is an instance of DataPlaceHolder.
      Raises a TypeError if the operation is not supported for the given types.
      


   .. py:method:: __ror__(other)

      Reverse pipe operator for DataPlaceHolder.

      :param other: The input data to be transformed.
      :type other: DataPlaceHolder

      :returns: The result of applying the fit_transform method on the input data.

      :raises TypeError: If the operand types are not supported for this operation.
